TODO: There is a brief description of the application in REFLECTION.md that
highlights the key design decisions for the application. The document also
contains a reflection of possible improvements that should be done to improve
the performance of the application.

All assignments are fetched at build time, and the assignment pages are
prerendered. This is fine in our case, as there exists no functionality to add
new assignments during runtime (apart from directly creating new ones in the
database).
